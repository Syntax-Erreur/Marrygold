 
### What Happens When You Click "Manage RSVP"?

The "Manage RSVP" button, located in the "Guest List" view (Individual mode), is meant to provide tools for handling RSVPs (Responses to Invitations). Here’s a detailed explanation of what likely happens when you click it:

#### 1. **Opens an RSVP Management Interface**
Clicking "Manage RSVP" typically opens a new modal, sidebar, or page that centralizes all RSVP-related actions. This interface allows the couple to:
- View the current RSVP status of guests.
- Update RSVP responses manually (e.g., if a guest informs them directly).
- Send reminders to guests who haven’t responded.
- Track RSVP statistics (e.g., total accepted, declined, pending).

#### 2. **Displays RSVP Status for Each Guest**
In the context of your app, the "Guest List" already shows event tags (e.g., "Haldi," "Sangeet") for each guest, indicating which events they’re attending. The "Manage RSVP" interface likely expands on this by showing:
- **RSVP Status**: Whether each guest has accepted, declined, or not yet responded for each event.
  - Example: For Raju Srivastava, it might show:
    - Haldi: Accepted
    - Sangeet: Pending
- **Event-Specific Responses**: Since your app tracks multiple events (Haldi, Sangeet, etc.), the interface might break down RSVPs by event, allowing the couple to see who’s attending which ceremony.
- **Food Preferences**: Already visible in the guest list (e.g., "Veg" for Raju Srivastava), but the RSVP management interface might allow editing this if a guest updates their preference.

#### 3. **Allows Manual RSVP Updates**
The "Manage RSVP" interface likely provides options to manually update a guest’s RSVP status. This is useful if a guest responds directly to the couple (e.g., via phone or in person) rather than through the app. For example:
- For Anshu Aditya, who has RSVP’d for "Haldi" and "Sangeet," the couple might manually mark them as "Declined" for Sangeet if they later inform the couple they can’t attend.
- This aligns with your earlier requirement for live guest list updates, where guests can change their RSVP if they’re no longer able to attend.

#### 4. **Sends RSVP Reminders**
The interface likely includes a feature to send reminders to guests who haven’t responded. In your app:
- There’s a "Send Invitation" button (with a WhatsApp icon) for each guest, indicating invitations can be sent via WhatsApp.
- Clicking "Manage RSVP" might show a list of guests with pending RSVPs (e.g., those who haven’t responded to the Haldi event) and provide a "Send Reminder" button. This could:
  - Send a WhatsApp message with a link to the guest portal to RSVP.
  - Send an email (since email addresses are listed, e.g., anshuaditya825301@gmail.com).
- This aligns with your earlier suggestion of an automated email for guests, which could be extended to include RSVP reminders.

#### 5. **Tracks RSVP Statistics**
The "Manage RSVP" interface might include a summary of RSVP stats, such as:
- Total invited: 50 guests.
- Accepted: 30 guests (for Haldi), 25 (for Sangeet), etc.
- Declined: 5 guests (for Haldi), 10 (for Sangeet), etc.
- Pending: 15 guests (for Haldi), 15 (for Sangeet), etc.
This helps the couple plan logistics (e.g., catering, seating) based on confirmed attendees.

#### 6. **Integrates with Other Features**
- **Table Assignments**: Since your app has a "Table Wise" view, the "Manage RSVP" interface might update the guest list dynamically, affecting table assignments. For example:
  - If Anshu Aditya declines the Sangeet event, they’d be removed from any Sangeet-related table assignments in the "Table Wise" view.
  - This supports the auto-generation of seating plans after RSVPs, as discussed earlier.
- **Guest Platform**: Your earlier requirement was for guests to have their own platform to RSVP, view ceremony instructions, and submit song requests. The "Manage RSVP" interface might include a link or toggle to configure guest portal settings, such as:
  - Enabling/disabling RSVP submissions via the guest portal.
  - Viewing song requests submitted by guests (e.g., Raju Srivastava might request a song for Haldi).

#### 7. **Export or Share RSVP Data**
Since the "Guest List" view has an "Extract to Excel" button, the "Manage RSVP" interface might also allow exporting RSVP data (e.g., a list of who’s attending each event) to Excel or sharing it with vendors (e.g., caterers needing food preference counts).

### How This Aligns with Your App’s Features and User Feedback
- **Live Guest List Updates**: The "Manage RSVP" functionality supports live updates by allowing manual changes to RSVP status and sending reminders to guests, ensuring the guest list reflects the latest responses.
- **Guest Platform Integration**: It likely ties into the guest portal, where guests can RSVP directly (e.g., via a link sent through WhatsApp or email). The couple can manage these responses centrally.
- **Table Assignments**: Updates to RSVPs (e.g., a guest declining an event) would reflect in the "Table Wise" view, ensuring the seating plan stays accurate.
- **Automated Emails**: The ability to send reminders aligns with your suggestion for automated emails to guests, which could also include ceremony instructions or song request prompts.
- **Food Preferences and Event Tracking**: The interface likely leverages the existing data (e.g., "Veg" for Raju Srivastava, "Haldi" and "Sangeet" for Anshu Aditya) to provide detailed RSVP management for multiple events.

### What Might the Interface Look Like?
Based on your app’s design, clicking "Manage RSVP" might open a modal or new page with:
- A table or list showing each guest, their RSVP status for each event (Accepted/Declined/Pending), and options to edit.
- A summary section (e.g., "Haldi: 30 Accepted, 5 Declined, 15 Pending").
- Buttons to send reminders to non-responders (e.g., via WhatsApp or email).
- Options to export RSVP data or share it with vendors.
- A link to guest portal settings (e.g., to enable/disable RSVP submissions or view song requests).

### My Thoughts
The "Manage RSVP" button is a critical feature for keeping the guest list up-to-date, especially in a multi-event wedding scenario like yours (with events like Haldi and Sangeet). It likely provides a centralized way to track and update RSVPs, send reminders, and ensure the data integrates with other features like table assignments and the guest portal. If it doesn’t already include features like sending automated reminders or tracking song requests, you might consider adding those to align with your earlier feedback about enhancing the guest experience (e.g., providing ceremony instructions, collecting song requests).
